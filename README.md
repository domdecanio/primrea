# PRIMRE-A

This work aims to help users access the already-public Portal and Repository for Information on Marine Renewable Energy ([PRIMRE](https://openei.org/wiki/PRIMRE/)) APIs. It is therefore called PRIMRE-Access (PRIMRE-A). The main functionality of the package is to compose the data accessible from the [Tethys](https://tethys.pnnl.gov/), [Tethys Engineering](https://tethys-engineering.pnnl.gov/), Marine Hydrokinetic Data Repository ([MHKDR](https://mhkdr.openei.org/)) and [Marine Energy Projects Database](https://openei.org/wiki/PRIMRE/Databases/Projects_Database) APIs into a relational database structure to facilitate data usage across knowledge hubs.

The completed feature set includes a partial implementation of the database schema on the Tethys and Tethys Engineering knowledge hubs, and data documentation/exploration in preparation for the implementation on MHKDR.
