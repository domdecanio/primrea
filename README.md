# PRIMREA

This work aims to help users access the already-public Portal and Repository for Information on Marine Renewable Energy ([PRIMRE](https://openei.org/wiki/PRIMRE/)) APIs. It is therefore called PRIMRE-Access (PRIMREA). The main functionality of the code is to compose the fields accessible from the Tethys, Tethys Engineering, and Marine Hydrokinetic Data Repository (MHKDR) APIs into a relational database structure, and provide a pathway toward integrating the Marine Energy Projects Database into this database schema.
